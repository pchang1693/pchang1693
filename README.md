### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in mobile app development, UX/UI design, and video game development. I graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science, Major in Computer Science.

Check out some of my personal projects in the repositories below.

Or, take a peek at some of my design work [here](https://pchang1693.github.io/).
